First, the K-nearest neighbors classification, plt when n_neighbors = 1 and n_neighbors = 3.

I tried to express it as a figure.

The second is K-NN classifier.

Depending on the values of the test accuracy and the training accuracy, the over-fit, 

the optimal point, and the under-fit are graphically displayed.

i've tried a variety of datasets and a quick look at what they are.

Use CancerDataset to find the relationship between generalization and complexity.
