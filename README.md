First, the K-nearest neighbors classification, plt when n_neighbors = 1 and n_neighbors = 3.

I tried to express it as a figure.

The second is K-NN classifier.


--> ( + n_neighbors_graph.py ) 

Depending on the values of the test accuracy and the training accuracy, the over-fit, 

the optimal point, and the under-fit are graphically displayed.
